CSCI 544 Homework 3
=====================
This is an instruction for CSCI544 Homework 3(http://appliednlp.bitbucket.org/hw3/index.html)

The code written for Python 2.7
Open source used: NLTK 


Description
-----------------
The goal is to develop an approach for detecting and correcting errors with similar sounds but different meaning:

           it's vs its
           you're vs your
           they're vs their
           loose vs lose
           to vs too

Because different pair of words have quite different language environment, I deal with the above 5 pairs of words separately. The features I use are: 
   
           p:prev_word   pt:prev_POS   n:next_word   nt:next_POS


Usage
-----------------
Use my averaged perceptron to perform part-of-speech tagging.

The training program, postrain, run as follows:

    python3 postrain.py TRAININGFILE MODEL

where TRAININGFILE is the input file formated with one sentence per line, and each sentence composed of word/tag pairs. For example, a small training file might contain these lines:

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT test/NN ./.

I/PRP saw/VBD a/DT movie/NN ./.

I/PRP like/VBP cookies/NNS ./.


and MODEL is the output file containing the model.

The postag program runs as follows:

    python3 postag.py MODEL < TESTINGFILE > OUTPUT

where MODEL is the model generated by postrain.

postag takes its input from STDIN in the form of one sentence per line,
where each sentence is a sequence of words (without tags). Output will be written to STDOUT, 
and will be a tagged sentence (in the same format as the training data) for each input sentence.
