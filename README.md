CSCI 544 Homework 3
=====================
This is an instruction for CSCI544 Homework 3(http://appliednlp.bitbucket.org/hw3/index.html)

The code written for Python 2.7
Open source used: NLTK 


Description
-----------------
The goal is to develop an approach for detecting and correcting errors with similar sounds but different meaning:

           it's vs its
           you're vs your
           they're vs their
           loose vs lose
           to vs too

Because different pair of words have quite different language environment, I deal with the above 5 pairs of words separately. The features I use are: 
   
           p:prev_word   pt:prev_POS   n:next_word   nt:next_POS

And I choose Naive Bayes algorithm to run the model.

Usage
-----------------
In the src directory, there are four files:
    errlearn_nb.py  # to train data
    errclassify_nb.py # to classify test data
    pos.py  # to get pos file

The training program, errlearn_nb.py, run as follows:

    python  errlearn_nb.py  TRAININGFILE  POSFILE  MODEL

where TRAININGFILE is the input file with correct words. For example, a small training file might contain these lines:

Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses.

POSFILE contains pos tag of TRAININGFILE, run as follows:

    python  pos.py  TRAININGFILE  POSFILE

and MODEL is the output file containing the model.

The errclassify_nb.py program runs as follows:

    python  errclassify.py  MODEL  POSFILE   TESTINGFILE

where MODEL is the model generated by errlearn_nb.py and POSFILE is the pos tag file of TESTINGFILE.

Data Source
-----------------
The dataset I use is from NLTK gutenberg, which contains several novels. 

Accuracy
-----------------
Accuracy of dev dataset is as below:

Total instance(lines):100000

Total lines need to be corrected: 6453

Total lines corrected: 5997

Total lines not corrected: 456
(of the 456, 260 lines are wrong at classifying "too" and "to")
